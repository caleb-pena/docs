## Overview

The RAG contextual answer model answers questions based on specified files in your RAG Engine document library. If the answer is not within the library, the model will say so. Optionally filter results to documents with matching labels, paths, or IDs. Note that if you specify multiple filtering fields (both labels and paths), only files matching **both** a specified label and path will be queried. Specifying multiple labels, though, matches when any one of the specified labels matches a given document.

You can manage your library either through the [library management endpoints](/reference/manage-library-ref) or through the [playground in the browser](https://studio.ai21.com/overview?source=docs) .

## Body Params

<ParamField body="question" type="string" required>
The question to be answered based on the content in your document library.  
Limit: 150 characters
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="path" type="string" optional>
Specify a path to restrict answers to documents that match these path, either as a complete or prefix match.  
That is, specifying `/pets/` would match documents labeled `/pets/` or `/pets/dogs/`.  
Use to focus the question on specific path in your library.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="labels" type="array of strings" optional>
Specify labels to restrict answers to documents with any of these labels.  
Labels are exact, case-sensitive matches, no substring matches.  
If you specify both a path and labels, then only files with *both* a path and a label match will be included.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="fileIds" type="array of strings" optional>
Specify which files should be included in the results.
</ParamField>

## Response

The casing and styling depends on whether you are using the SDK or looking at the JSON returned by a REST call. For the SDK, convert the fields below to camel case.

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
A unique identifier assigned by the API to identify the specific request that generated the response.  
This parameter can be useful for tracking and logging purposes, particularly if multiple requests are being made to the API.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="answerInContext" type="boolean" required>
True if an answer could be found, False if an answer could not be found.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="answer" type="string or null" required>
The answer to the question based on the provided context, or `null`/`None` if the answer cannot be found.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sources" type="array of objects" required>
An array of objects, where each object represents a source document in which the answer was found.  
Each source object contains the following:

- `document_id`: A unique identifier of the source document.

- `highlights`: An array of strings containing the sections of the source document that are relevant to the answer.  
- `publicUrl`: A URL pointing to the source document (if available).
