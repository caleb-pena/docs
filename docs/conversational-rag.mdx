## Overview

Conversational RAG allows you to build multi-turn, chat-based experiences that interact with your enterprise documents and data. Built on top of AI21â€™s advanced RAG Engine and infused with a planning layer, it enables users to ask follow-ups, and receive grounded, context-aware answers.\
Conversational RAG ensures accurate, high-quality answers that reflect your proprietary knowledge base.

## Key Benefits

**Chat with Your Data**\
Go beyond one-shot question-answeringâ€”enable follow-up questions, clarification loops, and multi-step problem solving via a natural, conversational interface.

**Enterprise-Grade Accuracy**\
Built on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), responses are grounded in your actual documents, not just model hallucination. Useful for internal tools and customer-facing applications alike.

**Fully Managed & Easy to Deploy**\
Simply upload your documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT,HTML or markdown). The RAG Engine automatically indexes them, making setup fast and seamless. Data connectors are coming soon.

**Supported Languages**

RAG queries are supported in the following 8 languages:

* English (default)
* Spanish
* French
* Portuguese
* Italian
* Dutch
* German
* Hebrew

To receive responses in a different supported language, simply set your preferred language using the language parameter in your API request.

### ðŸ’¡Note

We only support cases where the query and the documents being retrieved are in the same language.\
For example, if your query is in French, the relevant documents must also be in French.

## Product Details

Conversational RAG is a compound AI system that uses a planning module to assess incoming queries. It chooses whether to:

* respond solely using the **LLMâ€™s,** or
* route the query to the **RAG Engine** to retrieve grounded context before generating a response.\
  This hybrid architecture ensures quality, visibility, and flexibility across a range of enterprise applications.

## Input/Output Modalities

**Input**: Designed for multi-turn text conversations that reference your enterprise documents. This is the primary use case that delivers the most value - grounded, contextual responses. While designed for interactive dialogue with your data, the system can still handle other types of inputs (e.g., single-shot queries).

**Output**: Grounded, context-aware responses.

## Deployment & Document Ingestion

* Upload supported document types: .pdf, .docx, .txt, .md,html
* Indexing is automatic
* The conversational RAG system includes our in-house document parser, which provides high-quality parsing
* Coming soon: data connectors to cloud sources
