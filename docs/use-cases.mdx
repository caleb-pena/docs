### Use Case 1: Generate with requirement

In this example a user is asking Maestro to create a rhyme about a cat.
The requirements field defines specific conditions or rules that the generated content must meet.
In this case, there are two requirements:

**Length**: The rhyme must be exactly 5 lines long.
**Structure**: Each line of the rhyme must start with the letter "A".

```python Python
payload = {
    "input": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a rhyme about a cat"}
    ],
    "requirements": [{"name": "length", "description": 'Must be 5 lines', "is_mandatory": True}, {"name": "structure", "description": 'Each line starts with the letter A', "is_mandatory": True}]
}
)
```
