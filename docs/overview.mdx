## Accessing our Models and Solutions

You can access our tools and models through several mechanisms:

- **Python SDK:** We provide a [Python SDK](/docs/sdk) to simplify access to all our models and tools from your Python code. The SDK provides code completion tips, documentation, support for synchronous and asynchronous calls, and much more.

---

- **REST API:** Under the hood, our SDK, playground, and cloud platform implementations access our models through our [public REST API](/reference/jamba-1-6-api-ref).

---

- **Cloud platforms:** We provide model access from all the leading cloud providers. See the full list [here](/docs/model-availability-across-platforms).

---

- **Other third-party services:** Our models are also available on other third-party systems such as [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/ai21/) and [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/ai21/). Check your toolchain to see if AI21 is available.
