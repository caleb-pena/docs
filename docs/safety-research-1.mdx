description: "AI21 Labs is on a mission to make reading and writing AI-first experiences, with machines working alongside humans as thought partners, thereby promoting human welfare and prosperity. To deliver its promise, this technology must be deployed and used in a responsible and sustainable way, taking into consideration potential risks, including malicious use by bad actors, accidental misuse and broader societal harms. We take these risks extremely seriously and put measures in place to mitigate them."

AI safety is an important challenge with a large surface area, which we believe can be addressed most effectively by **working together**. We invite anyone interested in conducting research or otherwise promoting AI safety to contact us at [safety@ai21.com](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/) and explore opportunities for collaboration. We encourage members of the community to contact us at the same address to report bad experiences, vulnerabilities and suspected misuse of our products or to voice any other safety-related concerns.
