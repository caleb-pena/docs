## Overview

The library can hold an unlimited number of files, but a maximum of 1GB of files.

<ResponseField name="File metadata">
  Files support the following metadata:
  <Expandable title="Properties">
    <ResponseField name="fileId" type="uuid" optional>
      The unique identifier of the file, generated by AI21.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="name" type="string" optional>
      The name of the file specified by you.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="path" type="string" optional>
      An arbitrary file-path-like string you can assign to indicate the content of a file.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="fileType" type="string" optional>
      The type of the file.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="sizeBytes" type="int" optional>
      The size of the file in bytes.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="labels" type="array of strings" optional>
      The labels associated with the file. You can apply arbitrary string labels to your files and limit queries to files with one or more labels. Similar to paths, but labels do not prefix match. Labels are case-sensitive.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="publicUrl" type="string" optional>
      The public URL of the file, specified by you. This URL is not validated by AI21 or used in any way. It is strictly a piece of metadata that you can optionally attach to a file.

      The identifier of the user who uploaded the file.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="creationDate" type="date" optional>
      The date when the file was uploaded.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="lastUpdated" type="date" optional>
      The last update date of the file in the library.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="dataSource" type="string" optional>
      Where was the file uploaded from.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="status" type="string" optional>
      The status of the file in the library.

#### Filtering file results

When you create or update a file, you can optionally apply `path` and/or `label` values to a file. You can later search, query, or list files based on matching paths or labels. This can be useful to query subsets of documents.

For example, you can assign a path of either `/financial/USA` or `/financial/UK` to certain documents and later query only US financial documents, only UK financial documents, or query all financial documents by specifying `/financial/` as the path.
